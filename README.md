# Frontend Mentor - QR code component
In this small project, we should build a QR code component

## Overview 
In this project I use HTML and CSS,  this design is from Figma and I did this project using pixel-perfect tactics, I am a beginner and do not have enough experience, but I think it looks good.


**To do this challenge, I use basic CSS and HTML.**

## Process
First of all, I create a simple HTML document, then I add everything that I need in HTML (QR-code-image, heading one for higlighted text and paragraph) after that I connect my CSS style document and make little style for this project, I think that's all that I used to build this simple project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Pixel-perfect
